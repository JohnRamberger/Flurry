// In the given framebuffer, converts a 16bpp image to a 24bpp image.
// The three different 16bpp formats each have their own corresponding
// version of this function (for runtime optimization)
//
// Pass variables:
// u32 scrbfwidth  - Screen buffer width, in pixels. (On n3DS, always either 320 or 400.)
// u32 scrbfheight - Screen buffer height, in pixels. (Usually 240, or 120 for an Interlaced frame.)
// u8* scrbf       - Pointer to screen buffer
//
// Decently-written
// Designed for compatibility, to work on old-3DS.
// Supports variable height! And eventually native compatibility with weird cases like Mario Kart 7 (height of seemingly 256 px)
//
// Writes to the same buffer it reads from, but fills the buffer backwards.
// Basically. And it doesn't interfere with itself, or corrupt any data.
//
// Pixels are treated as Progressive.
// Thus, interlacing is done at time of DMA if at all.
// But these functions don't know or care about that.
//
// Errata:
// With a 16bpp input in RGBA4 format, the Alpha channel nibble is effectively ignored.
// As far as I know the 3DS doesn't really use the Alpha channel of each pixel in the framebuffer.
// In any case that it does, unexpected issues may arise.

// Pass variables:
// u32 flag      - option flag (4 = RGBA4, 3 = RGB5A1, 2 = RGB565)
// u32 passedsiz - size of current 16bpp frame (in bytes)
// u8* scrbuf    - pointer to framebuffer
// int* interlace_px_offset - &interlace_px_offset
//
// Proof-of-concept.
// Implementation is hacky, destructive, and not optimal.
// This will be obsolete when the DMA code is finished being refactored
// and optimized for interlaced functionality (both o3DS and n3DS)
//
// Errata:
// This function makes the Alpha byte always zero.
// The Alpha byte is usually ignored anyway, but if not
// then unexpected issues may arise.
